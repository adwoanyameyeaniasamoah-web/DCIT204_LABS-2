# DCIT 204 – Lab 2: Interactive Array Algorithms

## Objective

> **This assignment is due on Wednesday 1:10pm**

In this lab, you will build **interactive console applications** by implementing two fundamental array algorithms discussed in class:

* **Find Maximum Value**
* **Pair Sum (Brute Force Search)**

Unlike previous examples where arrays and target values were hardcoded, this assignment requires your programs to collect all necessary input from the user using Java's `Scanner` class.

The goal is to strengthen your understanding of:

* User input handling
* Arrays
* Loops
* Brute-force searching
* Time complexity
* Writing clean, readable Java code


---

# Task 1: Interactive Find Maximum Algorithm

Write a Java program that finds the **largest value** in an array **and its index**.

## Requirements

Your program must:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of elements in the array.
2. Create an integer array of that size.
3. Prompt the user to enter each array element one at a time.
4. Search through the array to determine:

   * The maximum value
   * The index where the maximum value occurs
5. Display the results in a clear and professional format.

# Task 2: Interactive Pair Sum (Brute Force)

Write a Java program that searches for **a unique pair of numbers** whose sum equals a target value.

## Requirements

Your program must:

1. Prompt the user for the array size.
2. Accept each array element from the user.
3. Prompt the user to enter a **Target Sum**.
4. Use the **Brute Force (Nested Loop)** algorithm to search for a matching pair.
5. If a pair is found, display:

   * Both indices
   * Their values
   * The equation
6. If no pair exists, print an appropriate message.
